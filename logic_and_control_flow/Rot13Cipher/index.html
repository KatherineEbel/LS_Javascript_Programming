    //  Requirements
    // 1. If the character is a letter, change it to the character 13 positions later in the alphabet.
      // (a  becomes n). If you reach the end of the alphabet, start back at the beginning. So m
      // becomes b.
    // 2. The letter transformation should preserve the case of the letter. A becomes N while a becomes
      // n.
    // 3. If the character is not a letter, it is not modified.
    // Write a Function rot13 that takes a string and returns that string transformed by the rot13
    // cipher.

    function rot13(string) {
      var cipherText = "",
          charCode;

        if ((char >= "a" && char <= "m") || (char >= "A" && char <="M")) {
          cipherText += String.fromCharCode(charCode + 13);
        } else if ((char >= "n" && char <= "z") || (char >= "N" && char <="Z")) {
          cipherText +=  String.fromCharCode(charCode - 13);
